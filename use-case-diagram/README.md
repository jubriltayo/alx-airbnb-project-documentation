### **Instructions**  

1. **Design the Diagram**  
   - Use **Draw.io** to create the use case diagram.  
   - Ensure it includes the actors (**Guest**, **Host**) and their specific interactions as described above.  

2. **Export the Diagram**  
   - Save the completed diagram as a **PNG** file.  

3. **Organize Your Work**  
   - Create a directory named `use-case-diagram/` in your GitHub repository (`alx-airbnb-project-documentation`).  
   - Place the PNG file inside this directory.  

4. **Commit and Push**  
   - Use the following commands to upload your work:  
     ```
     git add use-case-diagram/
     git commit -m "Added use case diagram for key functionalities"
     git push origin main
     ```

### **Expected Output**  
- A **PNG file** representing the use case diagram for guest and host functionalities.  
- The file stored in the `use-case-diagram/` directory within your GitHub repository.
