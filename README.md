## Documentation Outline

### 1. Use Case Diagram
A visual representation of system interactions for key features. It includes actors like **Guests**, and **Hosts** interacting with functionalities such as user registration, property booking, and payments.  

The diagram is available in the `use-case-diagram/` directory as `Use Case Diagram.png`.

### 2. User Stories
Key interactions have been translated into user stories to define development tasks clearly:

- **User Authentication**  
  - As a user, I want to register an account to become a guest or host and start using the platform.  
  - As a user, I want to log in securely using my email and password to access my account.  

- **Property Management**  
  - As a host, I want to update my property details to keep my listings accurate and appealing.  

- **Booking System**  
  - As a guest, I want to search for properties based on location, price, and amenities to find a suitable place to stay.  

- **Payment Integration**  
  - As a guest, I want to receive payment confirmation after completing a transaction to ensure my booking is secured.  

All user stories are stored in the `user-stories/` directory as `user-stories.md`.

### 3. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
The DFD maps data flow across the system. It highlights interactions between entities like **Users**, **Properties**, **Bookings**, and **Payments** and their respective data inputs, processes, and outputs.  

The diagram is available in the `data-flow-diagram/` directory as `data-flow.png`.

### 4. Flowcharts
Flowcharts provide detailed workflows for key backend processes. For instance:  
- **User Registration**:  
  Steps include form submission, input validation, user creation, and confirmation.  
The flowchart is stored in the `flowcharts/` directory as `data-flow-diagram.png`.
