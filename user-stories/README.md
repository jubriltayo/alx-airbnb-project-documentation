## **Task: Convert Your Use Case Diagram to User Stories**  

### **Objective**  
Translate the interactions from your use case diagram into clear, concise user stories.  

---

### **Instructions**  

1. **Review the Use Case Diagram**  
   - Using the use case diagram created in Task 1, analyze the interactions between actors and the system.  
   - Convert these interactions into user stories that capture the essential functionality from the perspective of the user.  

2. **Write User Stories**  
   - Write at least **5 user stories** that describe the core functionalities. Each user story should be in the format:  
     > “As a **[user type]**, I want to **[do something]** so that I can **[achieve a goal]**.”
   - Example:  
     > “As a guest, I want to be able to search for properties so that I can find a place to stay.”  

3. **Create the File**  
   - Create a file named `user-stories.md` in the `user-stories/` directory of your GitHub repository (`alx-airbnb-project-documentation`).  
   - Document the user stories in this file.

4. **Commit and Push Changes**  
   - Use the following commands to upload your file to GitHub:  
     ```
     git add user-stories/
     git commit -m "Converted use case diagram to user stories"
     git push origin main
     ```

### **Expected Output**  
- A **user-stories.md** file documenting the user stories for the Airbnb Clone backend.  
- The file stored in the `user-stories/` directory within your GitHub repository.
